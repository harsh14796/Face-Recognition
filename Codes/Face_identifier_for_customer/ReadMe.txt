After Doing the steps in readme of the main document follow these steps :


1) Give the appropriate link of the datasets and haarcascade_frontalface_default in create_data and face_recognize.
2) Run the program.


Note : Minimum of 2 datasets are required
       Increase the photo count in create_data to get better result. (while count < 60:)
       Make 0 to 1 if using any other attached camera. (webcam = cv2.VideoCapture(0))
       Better camera will give better results.
       If used for phone the results will be better since the camera quality is much better than webcam.
